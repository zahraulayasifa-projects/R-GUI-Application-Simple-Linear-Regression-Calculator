# 📊 Simple Linear Regression Calculator – R GUI Application

🔗 **Live App**: [Kalkulator Regresi Linier Sederhana](https://zahraulayasifa.shinyapps.io/KalkulatorRegresiLinierSederhana/)

A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** application developed using the **R Shiny** package to assist users in performing statistical analysis on **simple linear regression models**.

## 🔍 Overview
This Shiny app is designed to simplify the regression workflow by providing an interactive interface that incorporates both **significance testing** and **assumption diagnostics**, making statistical analysis more accessible and reliable for users at all levels.

## ✨ Key Features
- 📈 **Simple Linear Regression Model**
- ✅ **Significance Tests**
  - F-Test (overall model significance)
  - t-Test (individual predictor significance)
- 🧪 **Assumption Diagnostics**
  - Normality
  - Linearity
  - Homoscedasticity (equal variance)
  - Autocorrelation

## 🎯 Purpose
The integration of these statistical tools ensures that:
- The model is statistically valid
- The assumptions of regression are verified
- The predictive results are reliable and unbiased

## 🚀 How It Helps
This app enables users to:
- Conduct regression analysis without writing code
- Interpret results clearly through guided outputs
- Evaluate model performance through built-in diagnostic plots and tests

## 🛠️ Built With
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
- [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/)
- `ggplot2`, `car`, `lmtest`, and other supporting R packages
